# Time and Attendance Report Generator / Consolidator

In the effort of learning Java, I took a hot topic from the security industry and tried to implement it.

# App purpose:

Capture table like data from a local file (CSV for now) / DB that contain multiple events spread over multiple days (Card History) and compute the ammount of time each person spent working (Normal working hours & Overtime).

The app can perform such actions for multiple companies and store each setup under different Profiles, allow setting up details of parsing different type of cells, filter unwanted content and configure final reports content.
